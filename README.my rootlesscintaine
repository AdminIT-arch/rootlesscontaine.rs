## `rootlesscontaine.rs` ##

[`rootlesscontaine.rs`][rc] is a single-purpose website for tracking the
progress of rootless container support in various projects. I'm not good at
this whole "web development" gig, so I apologise for everything.

[rc]: https://rootlesscontaine.rs/

### Usage ###

This site is "built" using [Hugo][hugo], so just run the following:

```
% hugo server
Start building sites â€¦

If you want to actually compile the site for publishing, just run `hugo`. The
output will be in `public`.

### Theme ###

This site uses [Geekdoc][hugo-geekdoc] as the theme. Unfortunately it depends
on build-time postprocessing (using Gulp) and so we cannot use it as a
submodule and instead must vendor the release artefacts into this repository.

In order to update to a newer version of Geekdoc, download a [newer release
archive][hugo-geekdoc-releases] and extract it into `themes/hugo-geekdoc/`.

```console
% rm -r themes/hugo-geekdoc/
% curl -L https://github.com/thegeeklab/hugo-geekdoc/releases/latest/download/hugo-geekdoc.tar.gz | tar -xz -C themes/hugo-geekdoc/ --strip-components=1
```
